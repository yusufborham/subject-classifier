History: A Comprehensive Exploration
History is the study of past events, encompassing the complexity of human experiences over millennia. It involves analyzing artifacts, documents, oral accounts, and other sources to understand the development of societies, cultures, and civilizations. The study of history allows us to comprehend the present and anticipate future possibilities by learning from the successes and failures of the past.

Ancient Civilizations 
The dawn of civilization marks the beginning of recorded history. Ancient civilizations laid the foundations for modern society in areas such as writing, governance, religion, and technology. Among the earliest civilizations were Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China.

**Mesopotamia**

Mesopotamia, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is often referred to as the "cradle of civilization." The Sumerians, who inhabited this region around 3500 BCE, developed one of the first writing systems, cuneiform. They also made significant advances in mathematics, astronomy, and architecture, exemplified by their construction of ziggurats. The Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known legal codes, was developed in Babylon, a later Mesopotamian state.

**Ancient Egypt**

Ancient Egypt, centered along the Nile River, is renowned for its monumental architecture, such as the pyramids and the Sphinx. Egyptian civilization began around 3100 BCE and was characterized by a theocratic monarchy. The Egyptians made significant contributions to art, literature, and science. Their hieroglyphic writing system and their advances in medicine and engineering had a profound impact on subsequent cultures.

**Indus Valley Civilization**

The Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished around 2600 BCE, was one of the largest early urban cultures. It is known for its well-planned cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, advanced drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures. Despite its achievements, much about this civilization remains a mystery, including its writing system, which has not yet been deciphered.

**Ancient China**

Ancient China has one of the longest continuous histories in the world. The early dynastic period saw the rise of the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The development of Chinese writing, bronze casting, and the creation of early philosophical texts like the "I Ching" are hallmarks of this era. The Zhou dynasty introduced the Mandate of Heaven concept, which justified the rule of emperors and influenced Chinese governance for centuries.

**Classical Antiquity**

Classical antiquity refers to a period in history dominated by the Greek and Roman civilizations, which laid the intellectual and cultural foundations for Western civilization.

**Ancient Greece**

Ancient Greece is often regarded as the birthplace of Western civilization. The Greeks made groundbreaking contributions in philosophy, politics, science, and the arts. The city-states of Athens and Sparta epitomized different aspects of Greek society: Athens was known for its democratic governance and cultural achievements, while Sparta was renowned for its military discipline. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle explored profound questions about existence, ethics, and knowledge. The Greeks also established the Olympic Games and produced enduring works of literature and drama.

**Ancient Rome**

The Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire played a crucial role in shaping Western civilization. The Romans built an extensive network of roads and aqueducts, developed a complex legal system, and spread their language and culture across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Roman law, architecture, and engineering achievements, such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon, have had a lasting impact. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE marked the beginning of the Middle Ages.

**Middle Ages**

The Middle Ages, spanning roughly from the 5th to the 15th century, was a period of significant transformation in Europe, characterized by feudalism, the rise of the Christian Church, and the gradual emergence of nation-states.

**Early Middle Ages**

Following the fall of Rome, Europe entered a period often referred to as the Dark Ages. This era saw the decline of urban centers and a shift towards rural, feudal societies. The Christian Church became a unifying force, with monasteries preserving classical knowledge and missionaries spreading Christianity.

**High Middle Ages**

The High Middle Ages (1000-1300) witnessed economic and cultural revival. The Agricultural Revolution led to increased food production, population growth, and the resurgence of towns and trade. The Crusades, military expeditions aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land, had significant economic, cultural, and political impacts. Universities began to emerge, fostering intellectual growth and the rediscovery of classical texts.

**Late Middle Ages**

The Late Middle Ages were marked by turmoil and transformation. The Black Death, a devastating pandemic, significantly reduced Europe's population. The Hundred Years' War between England and France, and the rise of powerful monarchies, began to shape the modern nation-state. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the end of the Byzantine Empire also marked significant geopolitical shifts.

**Renaissance and Reformation**

The Renaissance and Reformation were periods of profound cultural, intellectual, and religious change in Europe.

**Renaissance**

The Renaissance, beginning in the 14th century in Italy, was a cultural movement that emphasized the rediscovery of classical knowledge and the pursuit of humanism. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael created masterpieces that remain iconic today. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 facilitated the spread of knowledge, making books more accessible and fostering an intellectual revolution.

**Reformation**

The Reformation was a religious movement in the 16th century that led to the fragmentation of the Catholic Church and the rise of Protestantism. Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, published in 1517, criticized the Church's practices and sparked widespread debate. The Reformation had profound social and political implications, leading to religious wars and the eventual establishment of Protestant churches across Europe.

**Age of Exploration**

The Age of Exploration, spanning the 15th to the 17th centuries, was driven by European nations seeking new trade routes and territories. Explorers like Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Ferdinand Magellan embarked on voyages that led to the discovery of new lands and the establishment of overseas empires. This period also saw the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, which had devastating effects on Africa and the Americas.

**Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment**

The Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment were periods of intellectual transformation that profoundly influenced modern thought.

**Scientific Revolution**

The Scientific Revolution (16th-18th centuries) was characterized by advancements in astronomy, physics, biology, and chemistry. Figures like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton challenged traditional views of the cosmos and laid the foundations of modern science. The scientific method, emphasizing observation and experimentation, became the standard for acquiring knowledge.

**Enlightenment**

The Enlightenment, an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of authority. Philosophers like John Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu advocated for political and social reforms, including the separation of church and state, and the promotion of human rights. The Enlightenment ideas significantly influenced the American and French Revolutions, leading to the spread of democratic principles.

**Industrial Revolution**

The Industrial Revolution, beginning in the late 18th century in Britain, was a period of rapid industrialization and technological innovation. It transformed economies from agrarian to industrial and led to significant social changes. Key inventions, such as the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom, revolutionized production processes. The rise of factories and urbanization altered living and working conditions, leading to both opportunities and challenges.

**19th Century and Imperialism**

The 19th century was marked by the rise of nationalism, the spread of democracy, and the expansion of European empires.

**Nationalism and Revolutions**

The 19th century saw the rise of nationalist movements seeking self-determination and the creation of nation-states. The French Revolution (1789-1799) and subsequent Napoleonic Wars reshaped Europe, leading to the spread of revolutionary ideals. The unification of Italy and Germany in the latter half of the century altered the political landscape of Europe.

**Imperialism**

The 19th century also witnessed the expansion of European empires into Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The "Scramble for Africa" saw European powers colonize nearly the entire continent, exploiting its resources and people. Imperialism had profound effects on the colonized regions, leading to significant cultural, economic, and political changes.

**20th Century: Wars and Globalization**

The 20th century was characterized by unprecedented conflict and technological advancement, leading to profound changes in global politics and society.

**World Wars**

World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) were two of the most devastating conflicts in human history. World War I, triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, involved most of the world's major powers and resulted in significant loss of life and political upheaval. The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, imposed harsh penalties on Germany and contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler.

World War II, initiated by Germany's invasion of Poland, saw the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) pitted against the Allies (primarily the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom). The war resulted in the Holocaust, the genocide of six million Jews, and the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The conflict reshaped the world order, leading to the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the beginning of the Cold War.

**Cold War**

The Cold War (1947-1991) was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies. It was characterized by ideological conflict, nuclear arms race,
The study of history is essential for a multitude of reasons, as it provides insights into the past, shapes our understanding of the present, and influences the course of the future. Here are several key reasons why history holds significant importance:

Understanding the Past: History allows us to understand the events, developments, and experiences of past societies and civilizations. By studying history, we gain knowledge of how people lived, interacted, and organized themselves in different historical periods and geographic regions. This understanding provides context for current events and helps us make sense of the world around us.

Preserving Cultural Heritage: History preserves and celebrates the cultural heritage and identity of communities, nations, and civilizations. It documents the achievements, traditions, languages, arts, and customs of diverse cultures, ensuring that they are passed down through generations and appreciated by future societies. Historical artifacts, monuments, and sites serve as tangible reminders of our shared human heritage.

Learning from Mistakes and Successes: History teaches valuable lessons by examining both the mistakes and successes of the past. By studying historical events, individuals and societies can learn from past errors, avoid repeating them, and identify strategies for addressing similar challenges in the present and future. History also highlights instances of resilience, innovation, and progress that inspire and inform contemporary efforts.

Promoting Critical Thinking: The study of history fosters critical thinking skills, analytical reasoning, and historical empathy. It encourages individuals to analyze primary and secondary sources, evaluate different perspectives, and construct evidence-based arguments. By engaging with historical debates and interpretations, students develop a deeper understanding of complex issues and learn to think critically about the world.

Shaping Identity and Belonging: History shapes individual and collective identities by connecting people to their past and fostering a sense of belonging to communities, nations, and civilizations. Understanding one's historical roots, heritage, and ancestors contributes to a sense of identity, pride, and cultural belonging. History also helps cultivate a shared national identity and collective memory among citizens.

Informing Decision-Making: History informs decision-making processes in various fields, including politics, diplomacy, law, economics, and public policy. Policymakers and leaders draw on historical knowledge to inform their decisions, anticipate potential outcomes, and develop effective strategies for addressing contemporary challenges. Historical insights provide valuable context and perspective for understanding current events and trends.

Promoting Social Justice and Equity: History sheds light on the struggles, injustices, and achievements of marginalized groups, promoting social justice and equity. By examining historical experiences of discrimination, oppression, and resistance, societies can work towards addressing systemic inequalities, promoting human rights, and fostering inclusivity. History serves as a tool for advocating for justice, reconciliation, and social change.

Preserving Democracy and Civic Engagement: History is essential for preserving democracy and fostering civic engagement. It educates citizens about the principles, values, and institutions of democratic governance, empowering them to participate in political processes, defend democratic rights, and uphold the rule of law. Historical knowledge encourages informed citizenship and active engagement in democratic societies.

In summary, history is important because it provides insights into the past, preserves cultural heritage, teaches valuable lessons, promotes critical thinking, shapes identity and belonging, informs decision-making, promotes social justice and equity, and preserves democracy and civic engagement. By studying history, individuals and societies gain a deeper understanding of themselves, their world, and their place in the continuum of human experience.History is essential for preserving democracy and fostering civic engagement. It educates citizens about the principles, values, and institutions of democratic governance, empowering them to participate in political processes, defend democratic rights, and uphold the rule of law. Historical knowledge encourages informed citizenship and active engagement in democratic societies.

Periodization of ancient Egypt
vte
The history of Egypt has been long and wealthy, due to the flow of the Nile River with its fertile banks and delta, as well as the accomplishments of Egypt's native inhabitants and outside influence. Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone. Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Ancient Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first king of the First Dynasty, Narmer. Predominantly native Egyptian rule lasted until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth century BC.

In 332 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and established the short-lived Macedonian Empire, which gave rise to the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom, founded in 305 BC by one of Alexander's former generals, Ptolemy I Soter. The Ptolemies had to fight native rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its final annexation by Rome. The death of Cleopatra ended the nominal independence of Egypt, resulting in Egypt's becoming one of the provinces of the Roman Empire.

Roman rule in Egypt (including Byzantine) lasted from 30 BC to 641 AD, with a brief interlude of control by the Sasanian Empire between 619 and 629, known as Sasanian Egypt.[1] After the Muslim conquest of Egypt, parts of Egypt became provinces of successive Caliphates and other Muslim dynasties: Rashidun Caliphate (632-661), Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), Abbasid Caliphate (750–935), Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171), Ayyubid Sultanate (1171–1260), and the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). In 1517, Ottoman sultan Selim I captured Cairo, absorbing Egypt into the Ottoman Empire.

Egypt remained entirely Ottoman until 1805, except during French occupation from 1798 to 1801.[2] Starting in 1867, Egypt became a nominally autonomous tributary state called the Khedivate of Egypt. However, Khedivate Egypt fell under British control in 1882 following the Anglo-Egyptian War. After the end of World War I and following the Egyptian revolution of 1919, the Kingdom of Egypt was established. While a de jure independent state, the United Kingdom retained control over foreign affairs, defense, and other matters. British occupation lasted until 1954, with the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1954.

The modern Republic of Egypt was founded in 1953, and with the complete withdrawal of British forces from the Suez Canal in 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser (president from 1956 to 1970) introduced many reforms and created the short-lived United Arab Republic (with Syria). His terms also saw the Six-Day War and the creation of the international Non-Aligned Movement. His successor, Anwar Sadat (president from 1970 to 1981) changed Egypt's trajectory, departing from many of the political, and economic tenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a multi-party system and launching the Infitah economic policy. He led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967. This later led to the Egypt–Israel peace treaty.

Recent Egyptian history has been dominated by events following nearly thirty years of rule by the former president Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian revolution of 2011 deposed Mubarak and resulted in the first democratically elected president in Egyptian history, Mohamed Morsi. Unrest after the 2011 revolution and related disputes led to the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, Morsi's imprisonment and the election of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as president in 2014.

Predynastic Egypt (pre-3150 BC)
Main articles: Prehistoric Egypt and Population history of Egypt

Artifacts of Egypt from the prehistoric period, from 4400 to 3100 BC. First row from top left: a Badarian ivory figurine, a Naqada II jar, a Bat figurine. Second row: a diorite vase, a flint knife, a cosmetic palette.
There is evidence of petroglyphs along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BC, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishermen was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 6000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River, where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society.[3]

By about 6000 BC, a Neolithic culture had taken root in the Nile Valley.[4] During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badari culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimde, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.[5]

Dynastic Egypt (3150–332 BC)
Main articles: Ancient Egypt and History of ancient Egypt
Early Dynastic Period and the Old Kingdom
Main articles: Early dynastic period of Egypt and Old Kingdom of Egypt
A unified kingdom was formed in 3150 BC by King Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion, arts, language and customs.


The Great Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza, built during the Old Kingdom.
The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period (c. 2700–2200 BC), which constructed many pyramids, most notably the pyramid of Djoser, constructed during the Third Dynasty and the Giza Pyramids, constructed in the Fourth Dynasty.

First Intermediate Period, the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period
Main articles: First Intermediate Period of Egypt, Middle Kingdom of Egypt, and Second Intermediate Period of Egypt
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years.[6] Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the Semitic-speaking Hyksos. The Hyksos migrants[6][7] took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes.

New Kingdom, Third Intermediate Period and Late Period
Main articles: New Kingdom of Egypt, Third Intermediate Period of Egypt, and Late Period of ancient Egypt

New Kingdom in the 15th century BC
The New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC) began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire from Syria to Upper Nubia. This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism, although some[who?] consider Atenism to be a form of monolatry rather than of monotheism. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later ruled and invaded by Libyans, Nubians and Assyrians, but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.[8]

Achaemenid rule

In the sixth century BC, the Achaemenid Empire conquered Egypt.[9] The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt, from 525 BC to 402 BC, save for Petubastis III and possibly Psammetichus IV, was an entirely Persian-ruled period, with the Achaemenid kings being granted the title of pharaoh.[9] Amyrtaeus' successful rebellion ended the first Achaemenid rule and inaugurated Egypt's last significant phase of independence under native rulers. The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch.[9] It fell to the Persians again in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh, King Nectanebo II, was defeated in battle.[9]

Second Achaemenid conquest
The Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy, was effectively a short-living province of the Achaemenid Empire between 343 BC to 332 BC.[10] After an interval of independence, during which three indigenous dynasties reigned (the 28th, 29th and 30th dynasty), Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC) reconquered the Nile valley for a brief second period (343–332 BC), which is called the Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt, thus starting another period of pharaohs of Persian origin.[11]

A team led by Johannes Krause managed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified individuals in 2017. Whilst not conclusive, because of the non-exhaustive time frame and restricted location that the mummies represent, their study nevertheless showed that these Ancient Egyptians "closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations, especially those in the Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa. What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans—conquered the empire".[12]

Greek rule
Ptolemaic Kingdom

The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.[13][14]

The last ruler from the Ptolemaic dynasty was Cleopatra, who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony, who had died in her arms (from a self-inflicted stab wound) after Augustus had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled.

The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians, often caused by an unwanted regime, and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless, Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest. The native Egyptian/Coptic culture continued to exist as well (the Coptic language itself was Egypt's most widely spoken language until at least the 10th century).

Roman Egypt

Egypt quickly became the Empire's breadbasket supplying the greater portion of the Empire's grain in addition to flax, papyrus, glass and many other finished goods. The city of Alexandria became a key trading outpost for the Roman Empire (by some accounts, the most important for a time). Shipping from Egypt regularly reached India and Ethiopia among other international destinations.[15] It was also a leading (perhaps the leading) scientific and technological center of the Empire. Scholars such as Ptolemy, Hypatia, and Heron broke new ground in astronomy, mathematics, and other disciplines. Culturally, the city of Alexandria at times rivaled Rome in its importance.[16]

Diocese of Egypt
Main article: Diocese of Egypt

The Hanging Church of Cairo, first built in the 3rd or 4th century, is one of the most famous Coptic Orthodox churches in Egypt.
Christianity reached Egypt relatively early in the evangelist period of the first century (traditionally credited to Mark the Evangelist).[17] Alexandria, Egypt and Antioch, Syria quickly became the leading centers of Christianity.[18] Diocletian's reign marked the transition from the classical Roman to the Late antique/Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.[19]

Sassanid Conquest of Egypt
Sasanian Egypt (known in Middle Persian sources as Agiptus) refers to the brief rule of Egypt and parts of Libya by the Sasanian Empire, which lasted from 619 to 629,[20] until the Sasanian rebel Shahrbaraz made an alliance with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius and had control over Egypt returned to him.[20]

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian invasion early in the 7th century, until 639–642, when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Arab Islamic Empire. The final loss of Egypt was of incalculable significance to the Byzantine Empire, which had relied on Egypt for many agricultural and manufactured goods.

When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country. Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with their Christian traditions as well as other indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.[17] These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.[21][page needed]

Muslim rulers nominated by the Islamic Caliphate remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, with Cairo as the seat of the Caliphate under the Fatimids.[dubious – discuss] With the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluks, a Turco-Circassian military caste, took control about AD 1250. By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies.[22] The Greek and Coptic languages and cultures went into a steep decline in favor of Arabic culture (though Coptic managed to last as a spoken language until the 17th century and remains a liturgical language today).

The Mamluks continued to govern the country until the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 40% of the population of Egypt.[23]

Main article: History of Ottoman Egypt

Selim I (1470–1520), conquered Egypt
After the 15th century, the Ottoman invasion pushed the Egyptian system into decline. The defensive militarization damaged its civil society and economic institutions.[22] The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of the plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade.[22] Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and 1731.[24] The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.[25]

The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte began in 1798. The campaign eventually led to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, creating the field of Egyptology. Despite early victories and an initially successful expedition into Syria, Napoleon and his Armée d'Orient were eventually defeated and forced to withdraw, especially after suffering the defeat of the supporting French fleet at the Battle of the Nile.

Muhammed Ali Dynasty

Map of Egypt under Muhammad Ali dynasty
The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman, Mamluk, and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and Albanians — who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans – wrestled for power. Out of this chaos, the commander of the Albanian regiment, Muhammad Ali (Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha) emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the Sultan in Istanbul as his viceroy in Egypt; the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction: Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali, an ambitious and able leader, established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952. After 1882 the dynasty became a British puppet.[26]

Muhammad Ali's primary focus was military: he annexed Northern Sudan (1820–1824), Syria (1833), and parts of Arabia and Anatolia; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans. He kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting result of his military ambition is that it required him to modernize the country. Eager to adopt the military (and therefore industrial) techniques of the great powers, he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the civil service.[27]

The introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton, the Egyptian variety of which became notable, transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture before the end of the century. The social effects of this were enormous: land ownership became concentrated and many foreigners arrived, shifting production towards international markets.[27]

British indirect rule lasted from 1882, when the British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel el-Kebir in September and took control of the country, to the 1952 Egyptian revolution which made Egypt a republic and when British advisers were expelled.

Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim (in September 1848), then by a grandson Abbas I (in November 1848), then by Said (in 1854), and Isma'il (in 1863). Abbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers, but they spent beyond their means. The Suez Canal, built in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. The cost of this and other projects had two effects: it led to enormous debt to European banks, and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required. In 1875, Ismail sold Egypt's 44% share in the canal to the British Government. Ismail also tried to conquer the Ethiopian Empire and was defeated twice at Gundet in 1875 and again at the Battle of Gura in 1876.

Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, "with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government."[28]

Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with Ahmad Urabi a prominent figure. In 1882 he became head of a nationalist-dominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget. Fearing a reduction of their control, Britain and France intervened militarily, bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the battle of Tel el-Kebir.[29] They reinstalled Ismail's son Tewfik as the figurehead of a de facto British protectorate.[30][31] In 1914, the Protectorate was made official, and the Ottoman Empire no longer had a role. The title for the head of state, which in 1867 had changed from pasha to khedive, was changed again to sultan. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, Hussein Kamel, as sultan.[32]

In 1906, the Dinshaway Incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. After the First World War, Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919, the country arose in its first modern revolution. The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on 22 February 1922.[33]

The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad.

British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954.[34]

Republican Egypt (since 1953)
Main articles: History of republican Egypt and History of modern Egypt
On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser – the real architect of the 1952 movement – and was later put under house arrest.

Nasser era
Main article: History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser

Gamal Abdel Nasser
Nasser assumed power as president in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He nationalized the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956, prompting the 1956 Suez Crisis.

In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when Syria seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen (the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen) known as the United Arab States.

In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel invaded and occupied Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Three years later (1970), President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.

Sadat era

Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition.

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the October War, a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory that Israel had captured six years earlier. Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force, and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy. The conflict sparked an international crisis between the US and the USSR, both of whom intervened. The second UN-mandated ceasefire halted military action. While the war ended with a military stalemate, it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.[citation needed]

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians.[35] On 6 October 1981, Sadat and six diplomats were assassinated while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War. He was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak.

Terrorist insurgency
Main article: Terrorism in Egypt
In 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe, and began to target Copts and foreign tourists as well as government officials.[36] Some scholars and authors have credited Islamist writer Sayyid Qutb, who was executed in 1967, as the inspiration for the new wave of attacks.[37][38]

The 1990s saw an Islamist group, al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, engage in an extended campaign of violence, from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals, to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners. Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt's economy—tourism[39]—and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support.[40]

Victims of the campaign against the Egyptian state from 1992 to 1997 exceeded 1,200[41] and included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a speaker of parliament (Rifaat el-Mahgoub), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.[42] At times, travel by foreigners in parts of Upper Egypt was severely restricted and dangerous.[43] On 17 November 1997, 62 people, mostly tourists, were killed near Luxor. The assailants trapped the people in the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. During this period, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya was given support by the governments of Iran and Sudan, as well as al-Qaeda.[44][failed verification] The Egyptian government received support during that time from the United States.[44]

Civil unrest (2011–14)
Main article: Egyptian Crisis (2011–2014)
Revolution
Main article: Egyptian revolution of 2011
In 2003, the Kefaya ("Egyptian Movement for Change"), was launched to oppose the Mubarak regime and to establish democratic reforms and greater civil liberties.


Celebrations in Tahrir Square after Omar Suleiman's statement announcing Hosni Mubarak's resignation
On 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government. The objective of the protest was the removal of Mubarak from power. These took the form of an intensive campaign of civil resistance supported by a very large number of people and mainly consisting of continuous mass demonstrations. By 29 January, it was becoming clear that Mubarak's government had lost control when a curfew order was ignored, and the army took a semi-neutral stance on enforcing the curfew decree.

On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak had stepped down and that the Egyptian military would assume control of the nation's affairs in the short term.[45][46] Jubilant celebrations broke out in Tahrir Square at the news.[47] Mubarak may have left Cairo for Sharm el-Sheikh the previous night, before or shortly after the airing of a taped speech in which Mubarak vowed he would not step down or leave.[48]

On 13 February 2011, the high level military command of Egypt announced that both the constitution and the parliament of Egypt had been dissolved. The parliamentary election was to be held in September.[49]

A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 2011.[50] On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the Mubarak regime fell. Turnout was high and there were no reports of violence, although members of some parties broke the ban on campaigning at polling places by handing out pamphlets and banners.[51] There were, however, complaints of irregularities.[52]

Morsi's presidency
Main article: Timeline of the Egyptian Crisis under Mohamed Morsi
The first round of a presidential election was held in Egypt on 23 and 24 May 2012. Mohamed Morsi won 25% of the vote and Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak, 24%. A second round was held on 16 and 17 June. On 24 June 2012, the election commission announced that Mohamed Morsi had won the election, making him the first democratically elected president of Egypt. According to official results, Morsi took 51.7 percent of the vote while Shafik received 48.3 percent.[53] On 30 June 2012, Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypt's new president.[54]

On 8 July 2012, Egypt's new president Mohamed Morsi announced he was overriding the military edict that dissolved the country's elected parliament and called lawmakers back into session.[55]

On 10 July 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt negated the decision by Morsi to call the nation's parliament back into session.[56] On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet, including 28 newcomers, of whom four came from the influential Muslim Brotherhood while six and the former interim military ruler Mohamed Hussein Tantawi as the Defence Minister came from the previous Government.[57]

On 22 November 2012, Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution.[58] The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.[59]

The move was criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei, the leader of Egypt's Constitution Party, who stated "Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh" on his Twitter feed.[60] The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.[61] On 5 December 2012, Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution.[62] Six senior advisors and three other officials resigned from the government and the country's leading Islamic institution called on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal cities to desert towns.[63]

Morsi offered a "national dialogue" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamist-dominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest.[63]

A constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against.[64] It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012.[65] On 3 July 2013, the constitution was suspended by order of the Egyptian army.[66]

On 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed Morsi from power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and named Supreme Constitutional Court's leader, Adly Mansour as acting president.[67] Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 2013.[68]

After Morsi
Main article: Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014)
During the months after the coup d'état, a new constitution was prepared, which took effect on 18 January 2014.[69] After that, presidential and parliamentary elections have to be held in June 2014. On 24 March 2014, 529 Morsi's supporters were sentenced to death, while the trial of Morsi himself was still ongoing.[70] Having delivered a final judgement, 492 sentences were commuted to life imprisonment with 37 death sentences being upheld. On 28 April, another mass trial took place with 683 Morsi supporters sentenced to death for killing 1 police officer.[71] In 2015, Egypt participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[72]

El-Sisi Presidency
Main article: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi

Satellite image of Ever Given blocking the canal in March 2021
In the elections of June 2014 El-Sisi won with a percentage of 96.1%.[73] On 8 June 2014, Abdel Fatah el-Sisi was officially sworn in as Egypt's new president.[74] Egypt has implemented a rigorous policy of controlling the border to the Gaza Strip, including the dismantling of tunnels between the Gaza strip and Sinai.[75]

In April 2018, El-Sisi was re-elected by landslide in election with no real opposition.[76] In April 2019, Egypt's parliament extended presidential terms from four to six years. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was also allowed to run for third term in next election in 2024.[77]

Under El-Sisi Egypt is said to have returned to authoritarianism. New constitutional reforms have been implemented, meaning strengthening the role of military and limiting the political opposition.[78] The constitutional changes were accepted in a referendum in April 2019.[79]

In December 2020, final results of the parliamentary election confirmed a clear majority of the seats for Egypt's Mostaqbal Want (Nation's Future) Party, which strongly supports president El-Sisi. The party even increased its majority, partly because of new electoral rules.[80]

During the 2020–2021 Tigray War, Egypt was also involved. On 19 December 2020, an EEPA report stated, based on testimonials of three Egyptian officials and one European diplomat, that the UAE used its base in Assab (Eritrea) to launch drones strikes against Tigray. The investigative platform Bellingcat confirmed the presence of Chinese-produced drones at the UAE's military base in Assab, Eritrea. Egyptian officials were concerned about strengthening ties between the UAE and Israel. They fear that both countries will collaborate in the construction of an alternative to the Suez Canal, starting from Haifa in Israel.[81] On 19 December 2020, Egypt was reportedly encouraging Sudan to support the TPLF in Tigray. It wants to strengthen a joint position in relation to negotiations on the GERD Dam, which impacts both countries downstream.[81]

#### Pre-Dynastic Period (c. 6000–3150 BCE)

The Pre-Dynastic Period marks the beginning of Egyptian civilization, characterized by the development of agriculture and the establishment of small villages along the Nile. Early Egyptians engaged in farming, fishing, and hunting, gradually forming complex societies. Significant cultural advancements, such as pottery and early forms of writing, emerged during this period.

#### Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150–2686 BCE)

The Early Dynastic Period began with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh, Narmer (also known as Menes). This unification laid the foundation for the centralized state and the development of a hierarchical society. The construction of elaborate tombs and the establishment of religious practices characterized this era.

#### Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE)

The Old Kingdom, often referred to as the "Age of the Pyramids," saw the construction of the most iconic structures in Egyptian history, including the Great Pyramid of Giza. Pharaohs like Djoser, Khufu, and Khafre commissioned grandiose building projects, showcasing their power and divine status. The Old Kingdom also witnessed the development of a sophisticated administrative system and a flourishing economy.

#### First Intermediate Period (c. 2181–2055 BCE)

The First Intermediate Period was a time of political fragmentation and social upheaval. Centralized power weakened, leading to rival factions and competing local rulers. Despite the turmoil, this period also saw significant cultural and artistic developments, as regional leaders commissioned their own monumental projects.

#### Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE)

The Middle Kingdom, often considered a "Golden Age," marked the reunification of Egypt under strong pharaohs like Mentuhotep II and Amenemhat I. This period was characterized by political stability, economic prosperity, and a revival of arts and literature. The construction of fortresses, temples, and public works projects flourished.

#### Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BCE)

The Second Intermediate Period was marked by the invasion and rule of the Hyksos, a foreign people who introduced new technologies, such as the horse-drawn chariot and advanced weaponry. Despite the challenges, native Egyptian rulers in Thebes eventually expelled the Hyksos and reclaimed their territory.

#### New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE)

The New Kingdom, often referred to as the "Empire Age," saw Egypt reach its peak in terms of power and influence. Pharaohs like Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten, and Ramses II expanded Egypt's borders through military conquests and diplomatic relations. This era also witnessed significant religious and cultural changes, including the brief monotheistic revolution under Akhenaten and the construction of monumental temples like Karnak and Luxor.

#### Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BCE)

The Third Intermediate Period was characterized by political instability and the division of Egypt into competing factions. Foreign invasions, including those by the Libyans and Nubians, further weakened centralized power. Despite these challenges, Egypt continued to produce significant artistic and cultural achievements.

#### Late Period (c. 664–332 BCE)

The Late Period saw a brief resurgence of native Egyptian rule under powerful leaders like Psamtik I and Nectanebo II. However, the conquest by the Persian Empire in 525 BCE and later by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE marked the end of independent Egyptian rule and the beginning of the Hellenistic period.

### Social Structure and Daily Life

#### The Pharaoh and the Royal Family

At the top of the social hierarchy was the pharaoh, considered both a divine deity and the earthly representative of the gods. The pharaoh wielded absolute power, overseeing the administration, religious practices, and military campaigns. The royal family, including the queen and royal children, played significant roles in governance and religious ceremonies.

#### Nobility and Officials

Below the pharaoh were the nobility and high-ranking officials, who managed various aspects of the state, including administration, agriculture, and trade. Viziers, priests, and scribes were crucial in maintaining the bureaucratic system and ensuring the smooth functioning of the state.

#### Priests and Religious Functionaries

Priests held considerable influence in Ancient Egypt, serving as intermediaries between the gods and the people. They conducted religious rituals, maintained temples, and interpreted omens and divine messages. High priests, especially those serving major deities like Amun and Ra, wielded significant political and economic power.

#### Scribes and Artisans

Scribes were essential to the administration, responsible for record-keeping, tax collection, and legal documentation. Their ability to read and write hieroglyphs placed them in a respected and privileged position. Artisans, including builders, sculptors, and painters, contributed to the construction and decoration of temples, tombs, and monuments, leaving a lasting legacy of artistic achievement.

#### Farmers and Laborers

The majority of the population consisted of farmers and laborers who worked the land and produced the food necessary for the survival of the civilization. The Nile's annual flooding provided fertile soil for agriculture, enabling the cultivation of crops such as wheat, barley, and flax. Laborers also participated in large-scale building projects, contributing to the construction of pyramids, temples, and infrastructure.

### Religion and Mythology

#### Polytheism and the Pantheon of Gods

Ancient Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses representing various aspects of nature, life, and death. Major deities included:

- **Ra**: The sun god, considered the king of the gods and the creator of the world. Ra's daily journey across the sky symbolized the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

- **Osiris**: The god of the afterlife and resurrection. Osiris was associated with death, rebirth, and the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertility to the land.

- **Isis**: The goddess of magic, motherhood, and fertility. Isis was revered for her protective and nurturing qualities, often depicted as a mother figure.

- **Horus**: The god of the sky, war, and kingship. Horus was associated with the pharaoh, symbolizing divine authority and protection.

- **Anubis**: The god of mummification and the afterlife. Anubis guided the souls of the deceased through the underworld and oversaw the embalming process.

#### Religious Practices and Temples

Religious practices in Ancient Egypt were integral to daily life and governance. Temples served as centers of worship, economic activity, and administrative control. Major temples, such as Karnak and Luxor, were monumental complexes dedicated to specific deities and hosted elaborate rituals and festivals.

Priests performed daily rituals to honor the gods, including offerings of food, drink, and incense. Festivals and ceremonies marked important events, such as the Opet Festival, which celebrated the renewal of the pharaoh's divine power, and the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, honoring the deceased and their journey to the afterlife.

#### The Afterlife and Funerary Practices

Belief in the afterlife was a central tenet of Egyptian religion. The Egyptians believed that life continued after death in a realm governed by Osiris. To ensure a successful journey to the afterlife, elaborate funerary practices and rituals were developed.

Mummification was the process of preserving the body for the afterlife, involving the removal of internal organs, drying the body with natron, and wrapping it in linen bandages. The deceased were buried with grave goods, including food, clothing, jewelry, and amulets, to provide for their needs in the afterlife.

Tombs were meticulously decorated with scenes depicting the deceased's life, religious texts, and spells from the "Book of the Dead," which guided the soul through the afterlife. The construction of grand tombs, such as the pyramids and the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, reflected the importance of the afterlife in Egyptian culture.

### Art and Architecture

#### Monumental Architecture

Ancient Egyptian architecture is renowned for its grandeur and durability, with some of the most iconic structures in human history:

- **Pyramids**: The pyramids, especially the Great Pyramid of Giza, are among the most recognizable symbols of Ancient Egypt. These monumental tombs were constructed for pharaohs and high-ranking officials, reflecting their divine status and ensuring their immortality.

- **Temples**: Temples were the religious and cultural centers of Egyptian cities. The temples of Karnak and Luxor, dedicated to the god Amun, are prime examples of Egyptian architectural prowess, featuring massive columns, obelisks, and intricate carvings.

- **Obelisks**: Tall, slender monuments carved from a single piece of stone, obelisks were erected to honor the gods and commemorate significant events. They were often placed at the entrances of temples, symbolizing the connection between the earth and the divine.

#### Sculpture and Painting

Egyptian sculpture and painting were characterized by their adherence to strict conventions and symbolic representations:

- **Statues**: Statues of pharaohs, gods, and officials were crafted with remarkable precision and detail. They

a second press at Annapolis in 1700. William Bradford brought printing to Pennsyl vania in 1685, when he established a press at Philadelphia. He also established the fi rst 
press in New York in 1693. Thus, by the end of the seventeenth century, there were 
permanent presses in Cambridge, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Their produc tions were modest, mainly government printing, forms, and sermons.
Thomas Short was the fi rst printer in Connecticut, arriving in New London in 1709 
to do the offi cial printing of the colony. It is unclear when printing fi rst came to New 
Jersey. William Bradford issued a book of laws, Anno Regni Georgii Regis, with the 
imprint Perth Amboy 1723, though some scholars doubt whether he would have moved 
his press from New York simply to issue this book. The fi rst permanent printer in New 
Jersey was James Parker, who established his press at Woodbridge in 1757. James 
Franklin, after running afoul of the authorities in Boston for publishing the New 
England Courant, settled in Newport in 1727, bringing his press and establishing a tra dition of lively journalism and literature in Rhode Island. Printing returned to Virginia 
in 1730 with the arrival of William Parks. In 1731, a monetary incentive offered by the 
South Carolina government attracted three competing printers to Charleston: George 
Webb, Eleazer Phillips, and Thomas Whitmarsh. All three soon died or left, though 
Louis Timothy, a protégé and business associate of Benjamin Franklin, took over the 
Whitmarsh press. James Davis, trained by William Parks in Williamsburg, became 
the fi rst printer in North Carolina in 1749, when he settled in New Bern and began to 
print the journal of the House of Burgesses. Punished by the Massachusetts Assembly 
for supposedly printing an objectionable pamphlet in 1754, Daniel Fowle consequently 
moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire and started the colony’s fi rst press in 1756. 
Delaware’s fi rst printer was also a Franklin apprentice: James Adams served more than 
seven years with Franklin and Hall in Philadelphia before he established his press in 
Wilmington in 1761. Finally, James Johnston, newly arrived from England, set up the 
fi rst press in Savannah, Georgia in 1762: he printed the colony’s statutes and began the 
Georgia Gazette in 1763.
With this chronology in mind, it is useful to think of the pre-1801 period of Ameri can printing in three distinct phases: the beginnings to about 1740, 1740 to 1776, and 
1776 to 1800. By 1740, the printing trade was fi rmly established, and, as James N. 
Green has argued, there was by this time a good deal of competition (see Hall and 
Amory 2000). There were fi fteen printing shops operating in nine towns, with five in 
Boston, two each in New York and Philadelphia, and single shops in Charleston, Wil liamsburg, Annapolis, Germantown, New London, and Newport. The number of 
newspapers had tripled to twelve, with fiercely competitive markets in Boston, New 
York, and Philadelphia. Newspapers provided printers with a new source of income that 
freed them from the economic control of colonial governments and provided a forum 
for opinions that the authorities found increasingly difficult to hold in check. By 1740, 
the fi ve printers in Boston were each issuing their own newspapers. More than any other 
factor, the rise of newspapers changed the nature of printing in the British colonies.
At the same time, the rate of printing of books and pamphlets accelerated rapidly. 
The output of the presses became more and more varied as a wider market developed

for materials beyond subsidized governmental publications, broadsides, sermons, and 
theological works. Consider the case of the Bible and its marketability. While Psalters, 
New Testaments, and other selections from the Bible were printed with some frequency 
in early America, the Bible itself was rarely attempted. It was far too complex and 
expensive for the average printing shop. In any case, only the universities of Oxford 
and Cambridge and the king’s printer enjoyed the privilege of publishing the Autho rized Version. As a result, Bibles were a staple of the import trade. The fi rst Bible 
printed in the New World was the Eliot Indian Bible (1663), a monumental effort 
typographically and linguistically. The fi rst American Bible printed in a European 
language was in German in 1743. The fi rst English Bible was printed by Robert Aitken 
in Philadelphia in 1782, more as an exercise in patriotism than as a bookselling venture: 
it included a resolution of Congress “recommend[ing] this edition of the Bible to the 
inhabitants of the United States . . .” This Bible was, in fact, a subscription book, and 
not a very successful one. But in a few more years Bible printing would become a sound 
business venture. More than thirty American editions of the English Bible appeared 
between 1788 and 1800, led by the efforts of Isaiah Thomas in Worcester.
One of the fi rst publications to issue from the press in English North America was 
An Almanack for New England for 1639, printed by Stephen Daye in Cambridge (no 
copy has survived). In a preindustrial, predominantly rural country, the almanac was 
a necessity, used by individuals from all walks of life, a household fi xture that was often 
kept hanging on a string from the fi replace mantle. Many almanacs were also used as 
diaries, George Washington being perhaps the most famous almanac diarist. In addition 
to monthly calendars and tables of astronomical events, almanacs included advice for 
farmers, medical and domestic receipts, and miscellaneous literary fare. In all its diver sity, the almanac had one great theme: time itself. As Nathaniel Ames expressed it in 
his almanac for 1744:
This little book serves well to help you date
And settle many petty worldly Things,
Think on the Day writ in the Book of Fate,
Which your own fi nal dissolution brings.
Unlike their English counterparts, which often emphasized astrology and necro mancy, the earliest almanacs in America stressed practical instruction and improvement, 
a reflection fi rst of Puritan infl uence (seventeenth-century Harvard students, most of 
them destined for the ministry, were some of the earliest compilers of almanacs) and later 
of the more enlightened intellectual climate of the eighteenth century. Even so, most 
almanacs featured the “man of signs” or “the Anatomy,” a crude woodcut of a human 
figure, with corresponding links to the signs of the zodiac governing various parts of the 
body. While the compilers were always quick to say that they themselves were not prac titioners of astrology, they included “the Anatomy” to appeal to “common” readers.
As printing spread in the colonies, almanacs followed as a matter of course. William 
Bradford published the fi rst almanacs in Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1686) and New 
Transatlantic Book Culture to 1800 265
York (1694), Timothy Green the fi rst Connecticut almanac (New London, 1709). In 
Newport, James Franklin, elder brother of Benjamin, assumed the pseudonym “Poor 
Robin” and printed the Rhode-Island Almanack for 1728. In Maryland, John Warner 
produced An Almanack for 1729, and The South-Carolina Almanack was advertised for 
sale in Charleston in 1733. In Williamsburg, Theophilus Grew’s Almanack for 1735 was 
advertised by the printer William Parks, who had moved to the Virginia capital from 
Annapolis. New Hampshire’s fi rst was An Astronomical Diary for 1757, printed in Ports mouth by Daniel Fowle. Poor Roger 1760: The American Country Almanac was printed in 
Woodbridge, New Jersey by James Parker, The Wilmington Almanack for 1762 was 
printed in Delaware by Thomas Adams, and The Georgia and South-Carolina Almanack
for 1764 was printed in Savannah by James Johnston. Not until after the War of Inde pendence were almanacs printed in North Carolina (New Bern, for 1784), Vermont 
(Bennington, 1784), and Maine (Portland, 1786).
The most famous compiler of almanacs in the eighteenth century was, of course, 
Benjamin Franklin. Assuming the mantle of Richard Saunders, Franklin issued his fi rst 
Poor Richard in Philadelphia in 1733, and remained personally involved in the series 
until 1758. “I endeavored to make it both entertaining and useful,” he wrote in his 
Autobiography, “and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap’d considerable 
profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand.” Records indicate that Poor Richard 
was distributed not only in Philadelphia but throughout the colonies. The reasons for 
its success are not hard to fi nd. Franklin had a knack for coining or adapting a proverbial 
phrase (“Men & melons are hard to know,” “Hunger never saw bad bread,” “Early to 
bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise”) but so did many other 
compilers of almanacs. Franklin’s genius was revealed in the personal essays that accom panied each edition. Through his prefaces, Franklin created a fictional character who 
assumed a life of his own – Poor Richard’s wife Bridget even contributed an essay one 
year. Engaging, witty, and lively, Franklin’s almanacs still make for entertaining 
reading.
Readers had certain expectations for their almanacs, and unnecessary innovation was 
not welcomed. As a rule, almanacs came with an explanation of the calendar, a list of 
eclipses for the year, the names and characters of planets, signs of the zodiac, and “the 
Anatomy.” They included such practical things as interest tables, courts and court days, 
lists of government offi cials, population tables, postal rates, bank officers, exchange 
rates, and time and place of religious meetings. For studying the development of local 
economies on the frontier, almanacs are useful sources. They are also anthologies of 
popular literature: epigrams, ballads, songs, satires, elegies, odes, epistles, essays, jokes, 
legends, proverbs, and anecdotes.
Almanacs were used effectively as propaganda in the American Revolution, support ing the patriots’ cause through verse, essays, and graphic illustrations. Before and during 
the War of Independence, the American press produced hundreds of polemical pam phlets, posted thousands of broadsides, and fi lled their newspapers with essays, letters, 
extracts of speeches, satirical and patriotic poetry, as well as offi cial proclamations. In 
the year of the Stamp Act, John Adams noted in his diary: “Innumerable have been 
266 Russell L. Martin III
the Monuments of Wit, Humour, Sense, Learning, Spirit, Patriotism, and Heroism, 
erected in the several Colonies and Provinces, in the Course of the Year. Our Presses 
have groaned, our Pulpits have thundered, our Legislatures have resolved, our Towns 
have voted . . .” (December 18, 1765). Compared to the more modest output of the 
preceding years, the publications of 1765 (354 surviving imprints) must have seemed 
“innumerable” to Adams or any other observer. The number of American imprints 
would continue to rise, peaking in the eventful years of 1774 (819 surviving), 1775 
(997), and 1776 (741), falling off during the rest of the war, and rising again once peace 
was established in 1783. By 1790, American printers were producing more than a 
thousand titles, and by 1800, more than two thousand.
Writing to Thomas Jefferson in 1815, Adams looked back at the transforming events 
he had witnessed and shaped, concluding:
The Revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, 
in the course of fi fteen years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington. The records 
of thirteen legislatures, the pamphlets, newspapers in all the colonies, ought to be con sulted during that period to ascertain the steps by which the public opinion was enlight ened and informed concerning the authority of Parliament over the colonies.
Following Adams’s suggestion, consider “the steps,” the distribution, of the Declaration 
of Independence. On July 8, 1776, four days after it was adopted by the Continental 
Congress, the self-evident truths of this document were proclaimed to an assembled 
crowd in Philadelphia. In New York on July 8, the Declaration was read to George 
Washington’s troops. However dramatic and forceful these oral presentations might 
have been, most Americans learned of the political separation from Great Britain 
through printed sources. The Declaration was printed in at least seventeen American 
editions in 1776 and 1777, while also being reprinted in virtually all the newspapers. 
The fi rst printing in Massachusetts, for example, was in the July 17 edition of the Mas sachusetts Spy, a patriot newspaper published by Isaiah Thomas in Worcester.
Of course, the Declaration of Independence did not appear in a vacuum. When 
readers opened the South Carolina & Georgia Almanack for 1777, they found a text of 
the Declaration along with more mundane information that helped them order their 
daily lives. Those almanac readers had grown accustomed to political as well as practical 
advice over the years. William Pitt’s “Speech for the Removal of the Stamp Act” was 
printed in the South Carolina & Georgia Almanack for 1767. “A Question of Taxation 
without Representation by a Gentleman of South Carolina” appeared in the almanac 
for 1771, and was followed in 1775 by the essay “Liberty the Birthright of Man.” The 
Declaration of Independence, then, was part of an ongoing print debate in all the 
colonies.
Print performed several key functions in transforming subjects of the British crown 
into independent citizens of the United States. First, there was a new emphasis on the 
diffusion of learning. “Without Knowledge among the People,” wrote Isaac Collins in 
his prospectus for the New-Jersey Gazette in 1783, “Liberty and publick Happiness cannot 
Transatlantic Book Culture to 1800 267
exist long in any Country; and this necessary Knowledge cannot be obtained in any 
other way than by a general Circulation of publick Papers.” This point was made more 
emphatically a few years later by John Fenno in the fi rst issue of the Gazette of the United 
States (New York, April 15, 1789): “The great and momentous subject of Education is 
hourly appreciating in its importance: That part of the new constitution, which 
opens the door to every man of rank, possessing virtue and abilities, to the highest 
honours in the great American Republick, has expanded the views of every American.” 
Of course, it had long been a commonplace in Anglo-American culture that newspapers 
in particular (and books in general) were meant to be both “useful and entertaining.” 
But the American Revolution had changed many of the social ground rules. The idea 
of equality – opening the door to “every man of rank, possessing virtue and abilities” 
– gave education a new signifi cance in the United States, unlike “any other country 
upon the face of the earth.” Fenno went on to say, “The middling and lower class
of citizens will therefore fi nd their account in becoming subscribers for this Gazette, 
should it pay a particular regard to this great subject.” In other words, by paying for a 
paper devoted to education, subscribers were in effect paying themselves (“their 
account”). Their money would not be wasted, especially if they could rise “to the highest 
honours” by reading their newspapers.
Secondly, there was a new emphasis on political liberty. Isaac Collins concluded his 
prospectus of 1783 with the injunction: “But if to save a few Pence, or a little Time in 
reading publick Papers, we should neglect them, Ignorance may gradually overspread 
this new enlightened land, and Tyranny advance as Knowledge decays, until Darkness 
and Slavery wrap this glorious Land in all the Horrors of despotick Sway.” For most 
African Americans, slavery was not a rhetorical flourish but a reality. As one reads the 
revolutionary newspapers and their constant appeals to liberty (of persons and the press), 
one is struck by the numerous times that slavery is mentioned in the same breath, not 
to mention the numerous advertisements for runaway slaves. Yet the language of the 
press is often biblical in phrasing and image. As Sam Adams wrote in the Boston Gazette:
“Your Press has spoken to us the words of truth: It has pointed to this people their 
dangers and their remedy: It has set before them Liberty and Slavery; and with the 
most perswasive and pungent language, conjur’d them, in the name of god, and the 
King, and for the sake of all posterity, to chuse Liberty and refuse Chains . . .” Notice able here is the quasi-divine power of the press: it speaks “the words of truth,” it con jures. In “The Art of Printing, a Poem” one fi nds the same attribution of supernatural 
power to the press: “Hail mystick art! which men like angels taught, / To speak to eyes, 
and paint unbody’d thought!” (The Lancaster Almanack, 1775).
Still, despite the limits and contradictions of the press during the Revolution (the 
treatment of James Rivington and other loyalist printers is a conspicuous illustration 
of how unwilling Americans often were to extend the freedom of the press to unpopular 
causes), a consensus did emerge that the free exercise of printing would invariably 
promote the public good. The question of human rights may have led to odd juxtaposi tions on the page, but it also led to Benjamin Rush’s An Address to the Inhabitants of the 
British Settlements in America, Upon Slave-Keeping (1773) and other early abolitionist 
268 Russell L. Martin III
literature. The printed word gave women a broader audience as well and helped to focus 
attention on their altered roles in the newly established republican order. As expressed 
in The Sentiments of an American Woman (Philadelphia, 1788), women too were “Born 
for liberty, disdaining to bear the irons of a tyrannic government.” And as John Mycall 
of Newburyport, Massachusetts, put it in his prospectus for The Temple in 1782: “The 
interests of Liberty are inseparable from those of learning and of virtue.” This is one of 
the enduring legacies of the Revolution. While The Temple itself may have failed as a 
weekly newspaper – and while the Revolution may not always have lived up to its ideals 
– the “simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense” of Thomas Paine’s galvanizing 
revolutionary pamphlet, reprinted in twenty-seven editions in 1776, took on a life of 
their own.
In 1771, Benjamin Franklin observed that subscription libraries “have improved the 
general Conversation of Americans, made the common Tradesmen and Farmers as intel ligent as most Gentlemen from other Countries, and perhaps have contributed in some 
Degree to the Stand so generally made throughout the Colonies in Defence of their 
Priviledges.” Franklin would know. With the support of his Junto, a group of young 
tradesmen interested in self-improvement, Franklin was instrumental in founding in 
1731 the Library Company of Philadelphia (an institution still very much with us and 
in the vanguard of book history research).
Although more than one hundred book catalogues of various kinds (college, subscrip tion, rental, private, booksellers’) were published in America before 1801, relatively few 
of them have been given the scrutiny they deserve. (For a comprehensive listing, see R. 
B. Winans, A Descriptive Checklist of Book Catalogues Separately Printed in America, 
1693–1800 [1981].) Yet library catalogues can help us situate authors, titles, and ideas 
in the broader world of colonial and revolutionary America.
Sir Isaac Newton’s presence in the Harvard College Library (founded 1638) is instruc tive. In the 1723 catalogue he was represented by only one work, his Opticks (London, 
1704). In the supplementary list of 1735, Newton’s Chronology (London, 1728) and his 
Observations on Daniel and the Apocalypse (London, 1733) were included. The 1773 cata logue included a multivolume set of his Works, in Latin and English, of unspecified
date. Between 1773 and 1790, however, Newton reached his zenith, as measured by his 
presence in the library, which by the later date held his Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms 
Amended in both the London and Dublin editions of 1728; the Arithmetica universalis,
second edition (London, 1722) and its English translation (London, 1748); the seventh 
edition of Tables for Leases (London, 1758); Optics (London, 1704, 1719, and 1721); Lec tiones opticae (London, 1729); Philosephiae naturalis principia mathematica (London, 1726 
and 1729; Geneva, 1729); De mundi systemate (London, 1731); Opuscula (Lausanne and 
Geneva, 1744); Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel and John (London, 1733 and 1754); 
and Two letters to M. LeClerc (London, 1754).
What are we to make of this? Were Americans, at the far end of the Atlantic world, 
simply slow to catch the latest waves in science? Not necessarily. We know from John 
Adams’s diary and from Professor John Winthrop’s lecture notes that Newtonian science 
was taught at Harvard while Adams was an undergraduate in the 1750s. The Harvard 
World War I left unresolved the question of who would dominate
Europe. The tremendous dislocations caused by the war laid the
groundwork for the collapse of democratic institutions there and set
the stage for a second German attempt at conquest. A worldwide de pression that began in 1929 destroyed the fragile democratic regime 
in Germany. In 1933 Adolf Hitler led to power the National Social ist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party, a mass movement that was viru lently nationalistic, antidemocratic, and anti-Semitic. He ended par liamentary government, assumed dictatorial powers, and proclaimed
the Third Reich. The Nazi government increased the strength of the
German armed forces and sought to overturn the Versailles Treaty, 
to recover German territory lost at the peace settlement, and to re turn to the so-called Fatherland German-speaking minorities within
the borders of surrounding countries. 
The ultimate goal of Hitler’s policy was to secure “living space” for
the German “master race” in eastern Europe. A gambler by instinct,
Hitler relied on diplomatic bluff and military innovation to overcome
Germany’s weaknesses. He played skillfully on the divisions among
the European powers to gain many of his aims without war. With the
Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini he announced a Rome Berlin alliance (the Axis) in 1935. Meanwhile, in the Far East, the
Japanese—the only Asian industrial power—coveted the natural re sources of China and Southeast Asia, but found their expansion
blocked by European colonial powers or by the United States. Hav ing seized Manchuria in 1931, they began a war against China in 1937.
The League of Nations failed to counter effectively Japanese aggres sion in Manchuria and an Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Soon Ger many, Italy, and Japan became allies, facing Western democratic gov ernments that wanted to avoid another war and the Soviet Union
whose Communist government was widely distrusted. 
The people of the United States, having rejected the Versailles
Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations after World War 
I, remained largely indifferent to most international concerns. They
firmly discounted the likelihood of American involvement in an-
4
other major war, except perhaps with Japan. Isolationist strength in
Congress led to the passage of the Neutrality Act of 1937, making it
unlawful for the United States to trade with belligerents. American
policy aimed at continental defense and designated the Navy as the
first line of such defense. The Army’s role was to serve as the nu cleus of a mass mobilization that would defeat any invaders who 
managed to fight their way past the Navy and the nation’s powerful
coastal defense installations. The National Defense Act of 1920 al lowed an Army of 280,000, the largest in peacetime history, but until
1939 Congress never appropriated funds to pay for much more than
half of that strength. Most of the funds available for new equip ment went to the fledgling air corps. Throughout most of the inter war period, the Army was tiny and insular, filled with hard-bitten,
long-serving volunteers scattered in small garrisons throughout the
continental United States, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Panama. 
Yet some innovative thinking and preparation for the future took
place in the interwar Army. Experiments with armored vehicles and
motorization, air-ground cooperation, and the aerial transport of
troops came to nothing for lack of resources and of consistent high level support. The Army did, however, develop an interest in am phibious warfare and in related techniques that were then being pi oneered by the U.S. Marine Corps. By the outbreak of war the Signal
Corps was a leader in improving radio communications, and Amer ican artillery practiced the most sophisticated fire-direction and -con trol techniques in the world. In addition, war plans for various con tingencies had been drawn up, as had industrial and manpower 
mobilization plans. During the early 1930s Col. George C. Marshall,
assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Geor gia, had earmarked a number of younger officers for leadership po sitions. Despite such preparations, the Army as a whole was unready
for the war that broke out in Europe on 1 September 1939. 
The Outbreak of War 
During March 1938 German troops had occupied Austria, in corporating it into the Reich. In September Hitler announced that 
the “oppression” of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia was in tolerable and that war was near. England and France met with 
Hitler (the Munich Pact) and compelled Czechoslovakia to cede its
frontier districts to Germany in order to secure “peace in our time.”
Peace, however, was only an illusion. During March 1939 Hitler
seized the rest of Czechoslovakia by force of arms and then turned 
5
his attention to Poland. Although Britain and France had guaran teed the integrity of Poland, Hitler and Josef Stalin, dictator of the
Soviet Union, signed a secret, mutual nonaggression pact in Au gust 1939. With the pact Stalin bought time to build up his strength 
at the expense of Britain and France, and Hitler gained a free hand 
to deal with Poland. When Hitler’s army invaded Poland on 1
September 1939, World War II began. 
While German forces overran western Poland, Soviet troops en tered from the east to claim their portion of that country. France and
Britain declared war on Germany and mobilized their forces. The 
subsequent period of deceptive inactivity, lasting until spring, became
known as the Phony War. Nothing happened to indicate that World
War II would differ significantly in style or tempo from World War I. 
But the years since 1918 had brought important developments in
the use of tanks. A number of students of war—the British Sir Basil
Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller, the Frenchman Charles de Gaulle, 
the American George S. Patton, and the Germans Oswald Lutz and
Heinz Guderian—believed that armored vehicles held the key to
restoring decision to the battlefield. But only the Germans con ceived the idea of massing tanks in division-size units, with infantry,
artillery, engineers, and other supporting arms mechanized and all
moving at the same pace. Moreover, only Lutz and Guderian re ceived the enthusiastic support of their government. 
In the spring of 1940 their theories were put to the test as Ger man forces struck against Norway and Denmark in April; invaded 
the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in May; and late in the
same month broke through a hilly, wooded district in France. Their
columns sliced through to the English Channel, cutting off British 
and French troops in northern France and Belgium. The French 
Army, plagued by low morale, divided command, and primitive com munications, fell apart. The British evacuated their forces from
Dunkerque with the loss of most of their equipment. The Germans
entered Paris on 14 June, and the French government, defeatist and
deeply divided politically, sued for an armistice. The success of the
German Blitzkrieg forced the remaining combatants to rethink their
doctrine and restructure their armies. 
With his forces occupying northern France and with a puppet
French government established in the south, Hitler launched the
Luftwaffe against the airfields and cities of England to pave the way 
for an invasion. Britain’s survival hung by a thread. From July to Oc tober 1940, while German landing barges and invasion forces waited
on the Channel coasts, the Royal Air Force, greatly outnumbered,
6
drove the Luftwaffe from the daytime skies in the legendary Battle 
of Britain. At sea the British Navy, with increasing American coop eration, fought a desperate battle against German submarine packs 
to keep the North Atlantic open. British pugnacity finally forced 
Hitler to abandon all plans to invade England. 
In February Hitler sent troops under Lt. Gen. Erwin Rommel to
aid the Italians who were fighting against the British in North
Africa. German forces coming to the aid of the Italians in the
Balkans routed a British expedition in Greece, and German para troopers seized the important island of Crete. Then, in June 1944,
Hitler turned against his supposed ally, the Soviet Union, with the
full might of the German armed forces. 
Armored spearheads thrust deep into Soviet territory, driving to ward Leningrad, Moscow, and the Ukraine and cutting off entire Soviet
armies. Despite tremendous losses, Russian military forces withdrew
farther into the country and continued to resist. Nazi expectations of a
quick victory evaporated, and the onset of winter caught the Germans
unprepared. Thirty miles short of Moscow their advance ground to a
halt, and the Soviets launched massive counterattacks. 
The Germans withstood the counterattacks and resumed their
offensive the following spring. The Soviets, now locked in a titanic
death struggle, faced the bulk of the German land forces—over two
hundred divisions. The front stretched for 2,000 miles, from the
Arctic Circle to the Black Sea. Soon casualties ran into the millions.
Waging war with the implacable ruthlessness of totalitarian regimes,
both sides committed wholesale atrocities—mistreatment of pris oners of war, enslavement of civilian populations, and, in the case of
the Jews, outright genocide. 
In the United States preparations for war moved slowly. General
George C. Marshall took over as Chief of Staff in 1939, but the Army
remained hard pressed simply to carry out its mission of defending the
continental United States. Defending overseas possessions like the
Philippines seemed a hopeless task. In early 1939, prompted by fears
that a hostile power might be able to establish air bases in the Western
Hemisphere, thus exposing the Panama Canal or continental United
States to aerial attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt launched a lim ited preparedness campaign. The power of the Army Air Corps in creased; Army and Navy leaders drafted a new series of war plans to
deal with the threatening international situation. The focus of military
policy changed from continental to hemisphere defense. 
After the outbreak of war in Europe the President proclaimed a
limited emergency and authorized increases in the size of the Regu-
lar Army and the National Guard. Congress amended the Neutrality
Act to permit munitions sales to the French and British, and large or ders from them stimulated retooling and laid the basis for the ex pansion of war production in the future. The Army concentrated on
equipping its regular forces as quickly as possible and in 1940 held
the first large-scale corps and army maneuvers in American history.
The rapid defeat of France and the possible collapse of Britain 
dramatically accelerated defense preparations. Roosevelt directed 
the transfer of large stocks of World War I munitions to France and
Britain in the spring of 1940 and went further in September when he
agreed to the transfer of fifty over-age destroyers to Britain in ex change for bases in the Atlantic and Caribbean. In March 1941
Congress repealed some provisions of the Neutrality Act. Passage of
the Lend-Lease Act, which gave the President authority to sell, 
transfer, or lease war goods to the government of any country whose

Germany spurred the Army to develop a barrage balloon force for
continental defense. (Army Art Collection)
defenses he deemed vital to the defense of the United States, spelled
the virtual end of neutrality. The President proclaimed that the
United States would become the “arsenal of democracy.” In the
spring of 1941 American and British military representatives held
their first combined staff conferences to discuss strategy in the event
of active U.S. participation in the war , which seemed increasingly
likely to include Japan as well as Germany. The staffs agreed that if
the United States entered the war the Allies should concentrate on
the defeat of Germany first. The President authorized active naval
patrols in the western half of the Atlantic , and in July, American
troops took the place of British forces guarding Iceland. 
Meanwhile, General Marshall and Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson made plans to expand the Army to 1.5 million men. On 27
August 1940, Congress approved inducting the National Guard into
federal service and calling up the reserves. A few weeks later the
lawmakers passed the Selective Service and Training Act, the first
peacetime draft in American history. By mid-1941 the Army had
achieved its planned strength, with 27 infantry, 5 armored, and 2 cav alry divisions; 35 air groups; and a host of support units. But it re mained far from ready to deploy overseas against well-equipped, ex perienced, and determined foes. 
n March, after the British repulsed another German attack, the
Allies resumed the offensive. The U.S. II Corps, now under the com mand of Maj. Gen. George S. Patton, attacked in coordination with an
assault on the German line by Montgomery’s troops. American and
British forces in the south met on 7 April as they squeezed Axis forces
into the northeastern tip of the country. The final drive to clear Tunisia
began on 19 April. On 7 May British armor entered Tunis, and Amer ican infantry entered Bizerte. Six days later the last Axis resistance in
Africa ended with the surrender of over 275,000 prisoners of war. 
The U.S. Army learned bitter lessons about the inadequacy of its
training, equipment, and leadership in the North African campaign.
Army Ground Forces acted quickly to ensure that American soldiers
would receive more realistic combat training. Higher commanders re alized that they could not interfere with their subordinates by dictat ing in detail the positions of their units. Troops had to be committed 
in division-size, combined arms teams, not in driblets. The problem
posed by American tanks, outgunned by the more heavily armed and
armored German panzers, took far longer to correct. But the artillery
established itself as the Army’s most proficient arm.
14
Sicily and Italy 
Meeting in Casablanca in January 1943, President Roosevelt,
Prime Minister Churchill, and the Combined Chiefs of Staff de cided that the large Italian island of Sicily would be their next target.
Montgomery’s British forces landed on the southeast coast, while
Patton’s newly activated Seventh Army landed on the southwest, 
with the mission of seizing airfields and protecting the flank of the
British drive. Airborne troops spearheading the attacks scattered
wide of their targets but managed to disrupt enemy communica tions. Hours after the initial landings on 9 July, German armor 
struck the American beaches. Naval gunfire, infantry counterat tacks, and the direct fire of field artillery landing at the critical junc ture broke up the German formations. But two attempts to rein force the beaches with parachute and glider-borne troops ended in
disaster when Allied antiaircraft batteries mistook the transport
planes for enemy aircraft and opened fire, causing severe losses. 
Meanwhile, the Germans solidly blocked the British drive on 
the Sicilian capital, Messina. General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander,
Allied ground commander, ordered Patton to push toward Palermo,
at the western tip of the island. Once in Palermo, since the British
drive was still stalled, his forces attacked Messina from the north.
Patton used a series of small amphibious end runs to outflank Ger man positions on the northern coastal road. American and British
troops arrived in Messina on 17 August, just as the last Axis troops
evacuated Sicily. 
In late July the Allies decided to follow up their success in Sicily
with an invasion of Italy. Having lost hope of victory, the Italian 
High Command, backed by the king, opened secret negotiations 
with the Allies. The Germans, suspecting that Italy was about to 
desert the Axis, rushed in additional troops. 
The Germans swiftly disarmed the Italian Army and took over its
defensive positions. A British fleet sailed into the harbor of Taranto
and disembarked troops onto the docks, while the U.S. Fifth Army
under Lt. Gen. Mark W. Clark landed on the beaches near Salerno 
on 9 September. The Germans reacted in strength. For four days 
vigorous attacks by German armor threatened the beaches. But on 
16 September American and British forces made contact, and two
weeks later American troops entered Naples, the largest city south of
Rome. Allied plans called for a continued advance to tie down Ger man troops and prevent their transfer to France or Russia, while 
Hitler decided to hold as much of Italy as possible.

As the Allies advanced up the mountainous spine of Italy, they

laying tactics of the German commander in Italy, Field Marshal Al bert Kesselring, exacted a high price for every Allied gain. The cam paign in Italy became an endless siege, fought in rugged terrain, in
often appalling conditions, and with limited resources. 
Moving north from Naples, the Allies forced a crossing of the
Volturno River in October 1943 and advanced to the Winter Line, a
main German defensive position anchored on mountains around
Cassino. Repeated attempts over the next six months to break or 
outflank it failed. An amphibious end run, landing the U.S. VI 
Corps under Maj. Gen. John P. Lucas at Anzio in January 1944,
failed to turn the German flank, for Lucas waited too long to build
up his reserves before moving aggressively against the German de fenses. Kesselring had time to call in reinforcements, including ar tillery, which soon brought every inch of Allied-held ground under
fire. As the defenders dug in, the end run turned into another siege,
as American and British troops repulsed repeated counterattacks. 
Meanwhile, an American attempt to cross the Rapido River,
timed to coincide with the Anzio landing, miscarried with heavy ca sualties. Allied efforts to blast a way through the enemy’s mountain
defenses proved futile, despite the use of medium and heavy bombers
to support ground attacks around Cassino. Finally, in May 1944, a se ries of coordinated attacks by the Fifth Army and Eighth Army pried
the Germans loose, and they began to fall back. On 4 June 1944, two
days before the Normandy invasion, Allied troops entered Rome. 
The Normandy invasion made Italy a secondary theater, and Al lied strength there gradually decreased. Nevertheless, the fighting 
continued. The Allies attacked a new German defensive line in the
Northern Appenines in August but were unable to make apprecia ble headway through the mountains. Not until spring of 1945 did 
they penetrate the final German defenses and enter the Po valley.
German forces in Italy surrendered on 2 May 1945. 
The Cross-Channel Attack 
Preparations for an attack on German-occupied France contin ued as did the campaigns in the Mediterranean. The defeat of the
German U-boat threat, critical to the successful transport of men 
and materiel across the Atlantic, had been largely accomplished by
the second half of 1943. The success of the war against the U-boats
was immeasurably aided by secret intelligence, code-named ULTRA,
garnered by Anglo-American breaking of German radio communi-
18
cations codes. Such information also proved valuable to the com manders of the ground campaign in Italy and France. 
By early 1944 an Allied strategic bombing campaign so reduced
German strength in fighters and trained pilots that the Allies effec tively established complete air superiority over western Europe. Al lied bombers now turned to systematic disruption of the trans portation system in France in order to impede the enemy’s ability to
respond to the invasion. At the same time, American and British
leaders orchestrated a tremendous buildup in the British Isles, trans porting 1.6 million men and their equipment to England and pro viding them with shelter and training facilities. 
Detailed planning for the cross-Channel assault had begun in 1943
when the American and British Combined Chiefs of Staff appointed 
a British officer, Lt. Gen. Frederick E. Morgan, as Chief of Staff to the
as yet unnamed Supreme Allied Commander. When General Eisen hower arrived in January 1944 to set up Supreme Headquarters, Al lied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), Morgan’s work served as the 
basis for the final plan of assault. The Allies would land in Normandy
and seize the port of Cherbourg. They would establish an expanded
lodgment area extending as far east as the Seine River. Having built 
up reserves there, they would then advance into Germany on a broad
front. Ground commander for the invasion would be General Mont gomery. The British Second Army would land on the left, while the
American First Army, under Lt. Gen. Omar N. Bradley, landed on 
the right. Intensive exercises and rehearsals occupied the last months
before the invasion. An elaborate deception plan convinced the Ger mans that the Normandy landings were a feint, and that larger, more
important landings would take place farther east, around the Pas de
Calais. Here the Germans held most of their reserves, keeping their
armored formations near Paris. 
Developments on the Eastern Front also aided the success of the
invasion. In early 1943 the Russians destroyed a German army at
Stalingrad. The Germans tried to regain the initiative in the summer 
of 1943, attacking a Soviet-held salient near the Russian city of 
Kursk. In the largest tank battle known to history, they suffered a re sounding defeat. Henceforth, they remained on the defensive, in 
constant retreat, while the Soviets advanced westward, retaking 
major portions of the Ukraine and White Russia during the fall and
winter and launching an offensive around Leningrad in January 
1944. By March 1944 Soviet forces had reentered Polish territory, 
and a Soviet summer offensive had prevented the Germans from 
transferring troops to France. 
The external history of a religious tradition often seems di vorced from the raison d'etre of faith. The spiritual quest is an 
interior journey; it is a psychic rather than a political drama. It 
is preoccupied with liturgy, doctrine, contemplative disci plines and an exploration of the heart, not with the clash of 
current events. Religions certainly have a life outside the soul. 
Their leaders have to contend with the state and affairs of the 
world, and often relish doing so. They fight with members of 
other faiths, who seem to challenge their claim to a monopoly 
of absolute truth; they also persecute their co-religionists for 
interpreting a tradition differently or for holding heterodox 
beliefs. Very often priests, rabbis, imams and shamans are just 
as consumed by worldly ambition as regular politicians. But all 
this is generally seen as an abuse of a sacred ideal. These power 
struggles are not what religion is really about, but an unworthy 
distraction from the life of the spirit, which is conducted far 
from the madding crowd, unseen, silent and unobtrusive. In deed, in many faiths, monks and mystics lock themselves away 
from the world, since the clamour and strife of history is re garded as incompatible with a truly religious life. 
In the Hindu tradition, history is dismissed as evanescent, 
unimportant and insubstantial. The philosophers of ancient 
X • Preface 
Greece were concerned with the eternal laws underlying the 
flux of external events, which could be of no real interest to a 
serious thinker. In the gospels,Jesus often went out of his way to 
explain to his followers that his Kingdom was not of this world, 
but could only be found within the believer. The Kingdom 
would not arrive with a great political fanfare, but would de velop as quietly and imperceptibly as a germinating mustard seed. In the modern West, we have made a point of separating 
religion from politics; this secularization was originally seen by 
the philosophes of the Enlightenment as a means of liberating re ligion from the corruption of state affairs, and allowing it to be come more truly itself. 
But however spiritual their aspirations, religious people 
have to seek God or the sacred in this world. They often feel 
that they have a duty to bring their ideals to bear upon soci ety. Even if they lock themselves away, they are inescapably 
men and women of their time and are affected by what goes 
on outside the monastery, although they do not fully realize 
this. Wars, plagues, famines, economic recession and the in ternal politics of their nation will intrude upon their clois tered existence and qualify their religious vision. Indeed, the 
tragedies of history often goad people into the spiritual quest, 
in order to find some ultimate meaning in what often seems 
to be a succession of random, arbitrary and dispiriting inci dents. There is a symbiotic relationship between history and 
religion, therefore. It is, as the Buddha remarked, our percep tion that existence is awry that forces us to find an alternative 
which will prevent us from falling into despair. 
Perhaps the central paradox of the religious life is that it 
seeks transcendence, a dimension of existence that goes be yond our mundane lives, but that human beings can only ex perience this transcendent reality in earthly, physical 
phenomena. People have sensed the divine in rocks, moun tains, temple buildings, law codes, written texts, or in other

men and women. We never experience transcendence di rectly: our ecstasy is always "earthed," enshrined in some thing or someone here below. Religious people are trained to 
look beneath the unpromising surface to find the sacred 
within it. They have to use their creative imaginations. Jean Paul Sartre defined the imagination as the ability to think of 
what is not present. Human beings are religious creatures be cause they are imaginative; they are so constituted that they 
are compelled to search for hidden meaning and to achieve an 
ecstasy that makes them feel fully alive. Each tradition en courages the faithful to focus their attention on an earthly 
symbol that is peculiarly its own, and to teach themselves to 
see the divine in it. 
In Islam, Muslims have looked for God in history. Their 
sacred scripture, the Quran, gave them a historical mission. 
Their chief duty was to create a just community in which all 
members, even the most weak and vulnerable, were treated 
with absolute respect. The experience of building such a so ciety and living in it would give them intimations of the di vine, because they would be living in accordance with God's 
will. A Muslim had to redeem history, and that meant that 
state affairs were not a distraction from spirituality but the 
stuff of religion itself. The political well-being of the Muslim 
community was a matter of supreme importance. Like any 
religious ideal, it was almost impossibly difficult to imple ment in the flawed and tragic conditions of history, but after 
each failure Muslims had to get up and begin again. 
Muslims developed their own rituals, mysticism, philoso phy, doctrines, sacred texts, laws and shrines like everybody 
else. But all these religious pursuits sprang directly from the 
Muslims' frequently anguished contemplation of the political 
current affairs of Islamic society. If state institutions did not 
measure up to the Quranic ideal, if their political leaders 
were cruel or exploitative, or if their community was humili-

ated by apparently irreligious enemies, a Muslim could feel 
that his or her faith in life's ultimate purpose and value was in 
jeopardy. Every effort had to be expended to put Islamic his tory back on track, or the whole religious enterprise would 
fail, and life would be drained of meaning. Politics was, there fore, what Christians would call a sacrament: it was the arena 
in which Muslims experienced God and which enabled the 
divine to function effectively in the world. Consequently, the 
historical trials and tribulations of the Muslim community political assassinations, civil wars, invasions, and the rise and 
fall of the ruling dynasties-were not divorced from the inte rior religious quest, but were of the essence of the Islamic vi sion. A Muslim would meditate upon the current events of 
his time and upon past history as a Christian would contem plate an icon, using the creative imagination to discover the 
hidden divine kernel. An account of the external history of 
the Muslim people cannot, therefore, be of mere secondary 
interest, since one of the chief characteristics of Islam has 
been its sacralization of history.
